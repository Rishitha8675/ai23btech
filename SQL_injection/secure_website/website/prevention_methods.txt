Some of the ways/measures to escape from SQLINJECTION attack are:
   1. Prepared Statements
   2. Input validation
   3. Input sanitization
   4.Use of properly constructed stored Procedures

Here I preffered first method
A prepared statement is a way to safely interact with a database
We should create a template for our query with placeholders instead of directly including user input
And then provide the actual value (like the userâ€™s input) to replace the placeholder (?).
This is done separately, which ensures the database treats it as data, not as part of the SQL command.

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId} ---> X
  (Vulnerable to SQL injection)

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? ---> _/
  (Not Vulnerable to SQL injection)  


Some other methods like input validation, input sanitization, stored procedures can also be preffered.
Input validation : Programming that ensures user input meets a system's expectations
Input Sanitization: Programming that removes user input which could be interpreted as code
Stored Procedures: Similar to the method prepared statements but stored procedures allow us to encapsulate a set of SQL statements and logic within a single unit.
Stored prcedure is a precompiled collection of one ormore SQL statements stored in the database. It is similar to a function in programming that can accept parameters, execute a sequence of statements, and return results.
