# Projects

## Encryption Algorithms

- File transfering sockets in python
- How AES and RSA are used for encrypting the data during data transfer
- client1.py and server1.py are the files in which AES key is sent to the server without RSA encryption
- client2.py and server2.py are the files in which AES key is sent to server with RSA encryption
- public.pem and private.pem contains a public and private key pair respectively
  

## SQL Injection

- Explanation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Examples of SQL injection attacks.
- Methods to prevent SQL injection.
